# Vectorized power flow calculation program

## Features
* Vectorized power flow calculation.
* Mocks for ieee5/118/1047 systems, for test and verification purpose.
* Callback support for ```pf``` function.
* Optimal step calculation support.
* Examples for usage of ```pf``` function.

## Dependencies
This project dependens on these projects listed below (also hold on [Github](https://github.com/)):
* [matlab-common](https://github.com/misterresse/matlab-common.git)
* [matlab-graphics](https://github.com/misterresse/matlab-graphics.git)

## System Requirments
* MATLAB 7.0 or later.

## Running
Here is a step-by-step tutorial that helps you to make this program working on your computer.

### Step 1
* Clone or download the [matlab-common](https://github.com/misterresse/matlab-common.git) and the [matlab-graphics](https://github.com/misterresse/matlab-graphics.git) projects into **a directory whose path DOESNOT contain any non-ascii characters**.
* Clone or download [this project's repository]((https://github.com/misterresse/matlab-opf.git) into the directory mentioned above.


> To clone a repository hold on Github, open your favorite Git client and then execute the command : ```git  clone url/of/source/repository  target/directory/you/prefer```. Visit [git-clone documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) for more details.


> To download a repository hold on Github, go to its home page, and then select the ```Download ZIP``` button on the upper right.

### Step 2
* Launch your MATLAB.
* Add the paths of all your downloads mentioned above to your MATLAB's search path(use ```Set Path``` command).
* Type ```pf_test``` in your MATLAB's ```Command Window``` and hit ```Enter```, **then enjoy**!
